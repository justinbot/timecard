timecard
========

A usable web-based payroll timecard system.

Despite its relative technical simplicity and use throughout every industry, timecard software is almost universally bad.
Timecard was imagined as a robust, modern, and user-friendly web-based system for employees to log their worked hours, 
and for managers to view their data for entry into a payroll system.

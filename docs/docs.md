# Timecard - Temporary Docs


### What is it?
Timecard is "A usable web-based payroll timecard system" designed to be:
- **Usable.** Intuitive and generally simple to use. Bonus: This helps reduce mistakes in hour entry.
- **Flexible.** Easily configurable for any organizationâ€™s needs.
- **Simple.** Simple to use, simple to set up, simple to maintain.
- **Powerful.** Makes use of the interesting data.


### Layout
The Timecard frontend can be divided into sections as follows:

The **User View** is a calendar-like view employees (or whomever is entering hours) see when they use Timecard.
- The number of days shown at once in the calendar is configurable as *Days to Display*.
- Selectable slots for each day start at *Start of Day* and end at *End of Day*
- The duration of each slot is configurable as *Slot Increment*.
- To fill or delete a segment of time, the user simply clicks a slot and drags out a segment. The change is immediately applied.
- *Templates* are a saved series of selections within a period which can be applied to any period.

The **Admin Panel** is the used by HR/Managers and consists of multiple sections.
- The **Users** section is used to add/remove/modify users and view hour data.
- The **Settings** section is used to add/remove administrators and configure Timecard settings.
